Skeleton project template using Vue, WebPack, .Net core and Docker.

The templates and files present here have been anonymised from another project of mine, which is at the time of writing running .Net Core via Docker in a Linux container hosted using Amazon Container Service.

Feel free to use this as a starting point for creating your own application.

Usage:
* Replace MaxMalmgren.SkeletonProject in every file and in every file name with your own project name.
* Replace the information in docker-* scripts in src/MaxMalmgren.SkeletonProject.Web with your own docker repository information / image names
